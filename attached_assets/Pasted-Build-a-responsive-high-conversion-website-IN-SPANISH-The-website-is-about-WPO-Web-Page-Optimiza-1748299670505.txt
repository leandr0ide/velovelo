Build a responsive, high-conversion website IN SPANISH.
The website is about WPO (Web Page Optimization) or website speed optimization.
with the following technical specifications:

1.Architecture Requirements

-Implement a component-based architecture following atomic design principles
-Utilize semantic HTML5 markup with appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
-Structure the codebase with clear separation of concerns (presentation/logic/data)
-Implement proper asset optimization with lazy-loading for all below-the-fold images
-Configure appropriate cache-control headers and leverage browser caching

2.Frontend Technical Stack

-React.js for component rendering with functional components and hooks
-CSS-in-JS solution (preferably styled-components) with a design system approach
-Progressive enhancement strategy for graceful degradation
-Implement critical CSS path rendering for above-the-fold content
-Establish mobile-first responsive breakpoints (375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)

3.Performance Optimization

-Target a Lighthouse performance score >90
-Implement code-splitting with dynamic imports for route-based chunking
-Optimize Core Web Vitals metrics:
   -LCP < 2.5s
   -FID < 100ms
   -CLS < 0.1

-Implement resource hints (pre-connect, prefetch, preload) for critical resources
-Optimize for TTFB < 200ms where server configuration permits

4.Conversion Elements

-Implement a strategic visual hierarchy with clear F-pattern or Z-pattern reading flows
-Place primary CTAs with 60px minimum touch target size and 3:1 contrast ratio
-Implement microcopy with action-oriented language adjacent to input fields
-Create form validation with inline error handling and real-time feedback
-Implement social proof elements with quantifiable metrics where appropriate
-Design scroll-triggered animations for key conversion elements using Intersection Observer API

5. Analytics Integration
-Set up event-based tracking for all user interactions
-Implement conversion funnel tracking with defined micro and macro conversions
-Configure appropriate UTM parameter handling for marketing attribution
-Implement cross-domain tracking where applicable
-Set up enhanced e-commerce tracking for product-related interactions

6. Security Implementation
-Implement proper Content Security Policy headers
-Configure appropriate CORS policies
-Implement rate limiting on form submissions
-Sanitize all user inputs with appropriate validation
-Implement CSRF protection on all form submissions

7. Technical SEO
-Implement structured data markup (JSON-LD) for appropriate schema types
-Create a programmatically generated sitemap.xml with lastmod attributes
-Implement canonical URLs and appropriate meta tags
-Configure proper robots.txt with crawl directives
-Ensure semantic heading hierarchy (h1-h6) throughout the site

8. Deployment Configuration
-Configure proper environment variables separation
-Implement CI/CD pipeline with pre-commit hooks for code quality
-Configure proper build optimization with tree-shaking
-Implement proper error logging and monitoring
-Configure appropriate redirects for legacy URLs

9.Output Deliverables
-Clean, documented source code with JSDoc comments where appropriate
-Comprehensive README with setup instructions and architecture decisions
-Performance optimization report with Lighthouse scores
-Mobile and desktop wireframes with annotated conversion elements
-Responsive breakpoint visualization

Generate the complete solution with an emphasis on measurable conversion metrics and scalable architecture.
